Soundbeans Coffee Shop

For my project, I decided to make a fictional coffee shop called 'Soundbeans'. The coffee shop is one that makes good coffee while also providing people with good music from small anr large creators alike. The small creators can come to the coffee shop to play their music to gain more following. Additionally, this music also serves as a relaxing moment for customers to enjopy their day with.

DESIGN RATIONALE

The colour scheme chosen was one that matched the coffee colours, different shades of brown to really show that this was a coffee shop.

The audience is for those coffee shop lovers as well as music enthusiasts who like a change of music every now and then. It also is to help promote local and small artists on their way to popularity. This website serves as a guide to show what the coffee shop has to offer as well as what they do.
